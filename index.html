<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I have learnt about HTML</p>
<p>I took the <a ref="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" target="_blank">W3 HTML Quiz</a>on Thursday 22-10-2020</p>
<p>I got 32 out of 40 i.e. 80%</p>
<h2>27th Oct 2020 - CSS</h2>
<p>Learnt about styling in CSS and what gets prioity in styling when HMTL pages are rendered. </p>
<p>Priority is: !important, inline CSS, ID, class, then elements. Never use the !important tag in code</p>
<p>Also learned about the div element and how it is a division of code</p>
<h2>29th Oct 2020 - Border, Padding, Margin, Positioning & Layout</h2>
<p>Now the lessons are getting more intense. We had Luke today instead of Alex. Was still good though. I was able to follow the lesson. It got a bit tricky when it came to positioning and layout. Guess this is where practice will make progress. I understand how one needs to take into consideration the padding and border when considering the height and weight of an element. It was interesting to see the positioning and layout in action. I've got to practice more of this particularly when it comes to the positioning relative to the parent. Found task 2.4.3 alright though. 
</p>
<h2>3rd Nov 2020 - CSS Positioning, Float, Framework</h2>
Alex's back! Lesson was alright. I particularly found the CSS framework pretty interesting. Heard of bootstrap previoiusly; so I see where it fits in now. Positioning and layout is still tricky. I think it would take practice, practice, practice.
I retook the HTML w3 quiz and got 33 out of 40 i.e. 82%
I took the CSS w3 quiz and got 20 out of 25 i.e. 80%
<h2>5th Nov 2020 - Javascript</h2>
<p>So javascript tonight. Pretty good! I think out ot HTML, CSS and javascipt, I'm going to like javascript the best...well I think! I do like logic and problem solving. Anyways highlights for me was learning what Javascript is; invented in 1995; not too long ago, variables, data tyoes, concatenation and calculations. Another good lesson! </p>
<h2> 11th Nov 2020 - Functions and logic operators</h2>
<p>It's getting intense now. Javascript is interesting, however, need to delve on this more. Sometimes, I think Alex goes beyond a beginners course. I can't imagine friends that are truly beginners at this stage...goodness don't think they'll survive. Well, saying that, there's the drop in sessions; they would have to leverage that. Anyho, learned today that we use functions so that we don't repeat ourselves. Nan = Not a number. You pass arguments to a function. Regarding logic, to check if a value equals something, you use == instead of =. Good session, let's see what there is ahead.</p>
