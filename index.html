<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I have learnt about HTML</p>
<p>I took the <a ref="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" target="_blank">W3 HTML Quiz</a>on Thursday 22-10-2020</p>
<p>I got 32 out of 40 i.e. 80%</p>
<h2>27th Oct 2020 - CSS</h2>
<p>Learnt about styling in CSS and what gets prioity in styling when HMTL pages are rendered. </p>
<p>Priority is: !important, inline CSS, ID, class, then elements. Never use the !important tag in code</p>
<p>Also learned about the div element and how it is a division of code</p>
<h2>29th Oct 2020 - Border, Padding, Margin, Positioning & Layout</h2>
<p>Now the lessons are getting more intense. We had Luke today instead of Alex. Was still good though. I was able to follow the lesson. It got a bit tricky when it came to positioning and layout. Guess this is where practice will make progress. I understand how one needs to take into consideration the padding and border when considering the height and weight of an element. It was interesting to see the positioning and layout in action. I've got to practice more of this particularly when it comes to the positioning relative to the parent. Found task 2.4.3 alright though.
