<h1> 1.4 - 15/10/2020 </h1>

<p> In today's session, we delved more into Git. Alex went on and on about how cool Git is. I can see why though. I lost track when we went through creating another branch and merging to the main branch. I'll have to try this again. I'm looking forward to adding more to the html file and viewing what's being built using Git pages. I chose the Midnight theme. Let's see how it goes. </p>

<p>Looks like I've cracked merging from a branch to the main branch. Just did it. I merged it on git though, not github. Anyways there are many ways to skin a cat :-)</p>

<p>I'll quickly write this question before I forget - How do we know what branch we're working on, on VS code? For example, when I change branch in github, how do I know what branch I'm working on when I'm working on VS code?</p>
