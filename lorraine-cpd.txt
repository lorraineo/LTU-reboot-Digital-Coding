Full speed ahead with CSS. Course becoming more technical which is cool. So finished HTML basics and now moved to CSS. I need to practice more between lessons. I wish Alex told us why stuff are the way they are. Like the CSS syntax for example; why is h1 a selector, background color a property and the particualr color the value.I get it; selector selects what in the html to apply the style to. Property is what style should be applied and value is the value of the style. Course progressing nicely though. Great!
